# Picture Frame: A Long Distance Virtual Object Interaction Technique

## Ian Morrissey & Jacob Walters

The picture frame is a long distance interaction technique that allows the user to create a picture frame as a secondary view of the virtual world. Through this frame they can select objects, manipulate them, and zoom in. Multiple frames can be used, the frame can be moved around, and frames can be deleted.
